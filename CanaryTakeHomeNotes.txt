CanaryNotes

Readme Notes:

I manually created seed data for an emission_sites and an equipment_groups table. That seed data is specified in ProjectCanaryDbContext.cs.



The frontend requires a .env.local file to point it to the dotnet backend. The backend is currently configured to port 5134, so the contents of this file should be
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5134


Questions:
Is it okay to assume that the columns in the csv files will always be in the same order?

What parts of estimated and measured emissions should be considered to be unique? If a user attempts to upload
the same data twice, we wouldn't want duplciates in the system. For estimates, my guess would be every column 
except for MethaneInKg (Latitude,Longitude,EquipmentGroupName,Start). For measurements, I would expect to
be able to reduce that to EquipmentId, Start (assuming that it EquipmentId really is a unique id in the system).

also add an import id so that you can delete everything from a specific import if you need to.

There are emissions whose latitude/longitude don't exactly match any of the sites. Should I look for the closest site to determine which they should be associated with?
Is there a certain proximity that should be considered close enough? Or should I get rid of any data that isn't exactly at the site?

In the unlikely case that a start and end time straddle a month or even year boundary, how should they be counted? Towards the year and month of the start date?

More questions and thoughts

I am storing the start/end times as utc in postgres. Hopefully I can treat these as local times.
